## 📚 SQL Stories - Case Study Showcase

This repository serves as a collection of end-to-end data analysis case studies. Each "story" simulates a real-world business problem and showcases a full analytical workflow, from understanding the stakeholder's request to building the data pipeline and delivering actionable insights.

The projects are powered by a custom, open-source [data generator](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/ecom_sales_data_generator) that produces realistic e-commerce data, complete with the kind of "messiness" found in production systems.

## 🧩 TL;DR

- This repository contains two complete, end-to-end data analysis case studies.
- All data is generated by a [custom Python data generator](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/ecom_sales_data_generator).
- Each case study includes a business brief, SQL code, an automated data pipeline, and stakeholder-ready deliverables (reports, notebooks, dashboards).
- **Story 01 (Inventory Audit)** and **Story 02 (Customer Retention)** are the primary, completed portfolio pieces.
- **Stories 3-5** are currently in development and will be added upon completion.

### ▶️ Where to Start

This repository contains two complete case studies. Each demonstrates a full analytical workflow, from business framing to technical execution and stakeholder-ready deliverables.

*   **Case Study 1: [Inventory Audit & Efficiency Analysis](story_01_inventory_audit/story_01_portfolio_readme.md)**
    *   **Focus:** Operational Analytics, Financial Impact
    *   **Summary:** A deep-dive into inventory management that quantifies $19M in locked capital, identifies at-risk SKUs with a custom scoring system, and provides an interactive workbook for business users.

*   **Case Study 2: [Customer Retention & Lifecycle Snapshot](story_02_customer_retention_snapshot/story_02_portfolio_readme.md)**
    *   **Focus:** Growth Analytics, Customer Segmentation
    *   **Summary:** An analysis of customer retention dynamics, identifying key churn drivers, high-value customer segments, and channel performance using cohort analysis and data visualization.

*   **In Development: Stories 3-5**
    *   **Focus:** Upcoming case studies will explore product profitability, operational impact analysis, and ad-hoc executive requests.
    *   **Status:** These scenarios are currently under development and will be added as they are completed.

> 📝 **Note for Portfolio Reviewers**
>
> This repository is designed to showcase a mature, end-to-end analytical process. It goes beyond simple SQL queries to demonstrate how I approach real-world business problems.
>
> Across these case studies, you will see:
> - **Strategic Business Framing:** The ability to translate ambiguous business needs (e.g., "improve efficiency") into concrete, measurable analytical objectives.
> - **Robust Technical Execution:** A full-stack data workflow, including complex SQL for data transformation, a Python-powered data pipeline for automation, and data visualization in notebooks and spreadsheets.
> - **Systematic Thinking:** The development of "Engineered Analytical Frameworks"—like the *Attention Flag System* in Story 01—that turn one-off analyses into scalable, reusable solutions.
> - **Clear Stakeholder Communication:** Deliverables tailored to different audiences, from executive summaries to interactive dashboards for business users, and detailed technical handoffs for peers.
>
> Together, these projects demonstrate versatility across different business domains (Operations vs. Growth) and a focus on delivering actionable, data-driven insights that have a measurable impact.


## 🧭 Orientation & Getting Started

<summary><strong>🧠 Notes from the Analyst</strong></summary>
<br>

**Perpetual Education**

This project started as a way to reinforce and build on my *SQL* skillset and has turned into a full ecosystem spanning multiple repositories, each handling a specific task from data engineering to analysis. I have learned and continue to learn from this ongoing experience.
<br><br>
This repository is a showcase of my continuing journey into Data Analysis. It demonstrates that I have built the skillset to be an asset and the understanding of how to make it valuable.

<summary><strong>🗺️ About the Project Ecosystem</strong></summary>

This portfolio is one part of a larger, interconnected set of projects. Here’s how they fit together:

*   **[ecom_sales_data_generator](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/ecom_sales_data_generator)** `(The Engine)`
    *   A custom Python package that produces the realistic, synthetic e-commerce data used in all the case studies. It's the source of truth for the data.
*   **[sql_stories_skills_builder](https://github.com/G-Schumacher44/sql_stories_skills_builder)** `(Learning Lab)`
    *   The public-facing skill-building suite. This is the main "product" where my published story modules are available for the community to use for practice and learning.
*   **`sql_stories_portfolio_demo` (This Repository)** `(The Showcase)`
    *   A curated and polished version of the best case studies, designed specifically to be a professional portfolio. It demonstrates the practical application of the tools and data from the other repositories.

## 🤝 On Generative AI Use

Generative AI tools (including models from Google and OpenAI) were used throughout this project as part of an integrated workflow — supporting code generation, documentation refinement, and idea testing. These tools accelerated development, but the logic, structure, and documentation reflect intentional, human-led design. This repository reflects a collaborative process where automation supports clarity and iteration deepens understanding.
