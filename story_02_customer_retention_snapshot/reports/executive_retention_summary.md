## 🧠 Retention Insights & Actions

### 📌 Early Engagement is Key

Cohorts lose approximately 11 percentage points in retention between Month 1 and Month 3, with the highest performing cohorts retaining close to 25% by Month 3, while weaker cohorts like Jan and Apr ’25 drop below 5% repeaters. This significant early decay highlights a critical window to engage customers before they churn.

</div>  

**Recommendation:** Deploy targeted win-back campaigns within the first 30 days to re-engage at-risk customers, especially focusing on underperforming cohorts like Jan and Apr ’25. Implement A/B tests on different incentive offers and communication channels to identify the most effective tactics for reducing early churn.

### 📌 Stable Conversion with Seasonal Spikes

The average first-to-second purchase conversion rate hovers around 34%, but Nov and Dec ’24 cohorts exceed 50%, illustrating a strong holiday effect that boosts initial repeat behavior. This seasonal spike suggests that timing and context significantly influence conversion success.

</div>  

**Recommendation:** Codify the successful elements of the holiday campaigns—such as promotions, bundles, and urgency messaging—and adapt these strategies for other seasonal peaks. Prioritize campaign planning to align with periods of heightened customer activity, and investigate whether these levers could be tailored to drive traffic and conversion during off-season periods with lower volume.

### 📌 Loyalty Program Gaps

The Bronze tier, which comprises a substantial portion of the customer base, shows a 0% repeat purchase rate, while Silver and Gold tiers perform below retention benchmarks at ≤15%. In contrast, the Platinum tier retains approximately 45–50% of customers, driving the majority of loyalty program ROI. This disparity indicates that lower tiers are not effectively motivating repeat engagement.

</div>  

**Recommendation:** Redesign the Bronze and Silver tier benefits to incentivize early repeat purchases with clear, attainable rewards. Simplify tier progression to create a more compelling growth path that encourages customers to advance through the loyalty program, thereby increasing overall retention and lifetime value.

### 📌 Channel CLV Mix Shows Clear Winners and Weak Performers

Analysis reveals that the Phone channel drives the highest proportion of high Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) customers at 58%, followed by Website and Email channels each contributing approximately 40% high-CLV customers. In contrast, Social Media underperforms with only 33% high-CLV customers, indicating weaker retention potential from this channel.

</div>  

**Recommendation:** Develop a strategic channel optimization plan that prioritizes scaling Email marketing efforts to capitalize on its strong CLV performance. Simultaneously, enhance Website SEO and conversion flows to increase high-value customer acquisition and retention. Redefine Social Media’s role to focus primarily on top-of-funnel brand awareness and customer acquisition rather than retention, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently to maximize overall customer lifetime value.
